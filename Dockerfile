# Container image for the Campaign Manager (TanStack Start + Nitro).
#
# The repo's default build target is a Cloudflare Worker bundle, which cannot run
# in a container. NITRO_PRESET=node-server makes the SAME source build as a plain
# Node server (.output/server/index.mjs). Checked: it builds and answers 200 on
# `/` and `/login` with no secrets and no environment variables set.
#
# Base images come from the AWS public ECR mirror of Docker's official images
# rather than Docker Hub or dhi.io. The repository has no registry credentials,
# dhi.io refuses anonymous pulls, and Docker Hub rate-limits shared CI runner IPs.
# Both stages take the same ARG, so moving to a hardened base later is one value.
